Paranoid - TOR Based multichain proxy
======================================


![](img/pr-terminal.png)

[Paranoid](https://github.com/s4vvi/paranoid) is a TOR based multi-chain proxy, to make deanonymization more difficult. The tool is a more simple implementation of the [DcLabs SPLITTER](https://github.com/renergr1nch/splitter). It is written in **Rust** using the [Arti](https://tpo.pages.torproject.net/core/arti/) project *(Most of the proxy code is ripped from the Arti project & modified)*.

**DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A WORKING PROTOTYPE**

[DcLabs SPLITTER](https://github.com/renergr1nch/splitter) issues that this tool fixes:
- It can be compiled as a standalone binary;
- It does not use docker & other 3rd party software;
- It only opens up a single port;
- Handles all connections internally;
- It's a simple tool that can be incorporated into automation scripts.

How it works:
1. The user defines an arbitrary amount of nodes & other options;
2. Tool spawns multiple TOR chains & opens a SOCKS5 proxy;
3. User creates request to the proxy;
4. The proxy receives every request & picks a random TOR chain;
5. The proxy forwards the request through the chain;
6. Nodes are queued for regeneration with a base interval.

Clone it from github via `git clone https://github.com/s4vvi/paranoid.git` & use `cargo build` to build it. The tool is really simple to use, here is the help menue anyway (`paranoid --help`):
